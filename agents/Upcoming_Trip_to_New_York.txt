Subject: Upcoming Trip to New York

Hi Bob,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to let you know about my upcoming travel plans. I’ll be heading to New York on November 10th to attend a wedding. I'm excited about the trip and looking forward to experiencing the city’s vibe again.

If you have any recommendations on places to visit or things to do while I'm there, I'd love to hear them!

Looking forward to catching up soon.

Best,

SY
